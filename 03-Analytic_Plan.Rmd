# Analytic Plan

Analyses will be gender stratified. The primary predictor variable of interest is time, with the purpose of investigating persistence and changes in exercise behavior over adolescent and young adult development. Secondary predictors include: BMI-Z score at age 13 and Eating Disorder Cognitions at Age 14. Parent SES will be entered as a covariate as it is possible, though not hypothesized, that exercise patterns may vary based on socioeconomic status. 

## Multi-State Transition Analyses

The first step in analyses will evaluate overall changes in the presence of exercise for weight loss and driven exercise over time in the sample. Visualization will be completed with transition plots [@cernatVisualizingTransitionsTime2021] for those completing all four assessment points. For those completing at least two assessment points, transition analysis will include multi-state Markov models [@jacksonMultistateModellingMsm], which will describe how individuals move between the 'No EWL', 'EWL', and 'DEx' groups over time. $$
q_{r s}(t, z(t))=\lim _{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \mathrm{P}(S(t+\delta t)=s \mid S(t)=r) / \delta t
$$. Exploratory analysis of transition states will examine whether baseline covariates (Parent SES, BMI-Z at age 13 years, eating disorder cognitions at age 14 years) predict transition amongst the three exercise states.  

## Missing Data

Prior to mixed-effects modeling, missing data will be imputed using the `mice` and `miceadds` packages [@R-mice; @R-miceadds]. Data to be imputed is included in Supplemental Table \@ref(tab:imptab). A mixed-model approach to imputation will be used. Time-invariant variables will be imputed at level-2 only using a Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) approach, and outcome variables will be imputed using 2-level approaches, which consider time (see Supplemental Table \@ref(tab:imptab)).

## Mixed Effects Modeling
Mixed Effects Models will examine whether levels of exercise for weight loss (Oridnal; [@christensenAnalysisOrdinalData2015; @christensenTutorialFittingCumulative2019]) and driven exercise (Binary; [@landermanModelingRepeatedMeasures2011]) change across age, using parameter pooling to combine models fit to the imputed datasets.

Nested models will be built  will allow for a random intercept for each individual, then a fixed effect of Time (assessment point - with baseline set to 14 years), followed by fixed effects for all baseline predictors and covariates, and, finally, all Predictor x Time interactions. Models will be compared via the multivariate Wald test (using the D3 statistic, as recommended) (cite StefVanBuren). Parameters for each model are presented in [Supplement 1][Supplement 1]
