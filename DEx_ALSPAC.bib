  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The criteria in the 4th ed. of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association) for bulimia nervosa include "excessive exercise" as an inappropriate compensatory behavior, suggesting that it is the quantity of the physical activity that is symptomatic, rather than its quality. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that psychological commitment to exercise (compulsive quality) will be more predictive of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors than the amount of time devoted to exercise (excessive quantity). METHOD: Female (n = 162) and male (n = 103) undergraduates completed the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) subscales, the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), and questions to assess the duration and frequency of exercise. RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, the OEQ score was a positive predictor of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and exercise time was a negative predictor. DISCUSSION: "Compulsive" may be a better description than "excessive" in characterizing exercise as a symptom of bulimia nervosa.},

  abstract = {Rationale Body dissatisfaction is prevalent among teenagers, and may influence the uptake of risky health behaviours. Objective The study assessed the influence of body dissatisfaction on smoking, cannabis use, drug use, self-harm, gambling, and drinking and the mediating role of disordered eating in a population-based sample of British adolescents. Method Participants were 2634 females and 1684 males from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Logistic regression was used to test if body dissatisfaction at 14 years old predicted the onset of risky health behaviours at 21 years old. Mediation analysis tested the mediating role of disordered eating at 16 years old on each risky health behaviour. Results Among females, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.40, 95\% CI\,=\,1.15, 1.72), cannabis use (OR\,=\,1.20, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00, 1.43), drug use (OR\,=\,1.51, 95\% CI\,=\,1.20, 1.90), self-harm (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.13, 1.84) and high-risk drinking (OR\,=\,1.41, 95\% CI\,=\,1.10, 1.80). Disordered eating symptoms had mediating effects on some behaviours. Among males, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.14, 1.81) and no effect of disordered eating was found on any risky health behaviour. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that body dissatisfaction in adolescence predicts the occurrence of several risky health behaviours, and elucidates the mediating role of disordered eating. The findings highlight that body dissatisfaction is a public health concern. Early interventions to promote body satisfaction may reduce the prevalence of later risky health behaviours.},

Recruitment sought to enroll pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrollment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

At age 14, gay and bisexual boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater body dissatisfaction than their same-gender heterosexual peers. All sexual minority boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater mean dysfunctional eating behaviors than their same-gender heterosexual peers. At age 16, gay and bisexual boys had 12.5 times the odds of heterosexual boys of binge eating; mostly heterosexual boys had over three times the odds of reporting binge eating. Sexual minority girls had over twice the odds of heterosexual girls of purging and binge eating. By mid-adolescence, sexual minority youth in the UK had elevated risk for eating disorder symptoms, suggesting the need for early prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {A transition between states - the above is a simulation of before and after surgery where I've highlighted the large proportion that doesn't improve in the moderate group. As an orthopaedic surgeon I'm often interested in how a patient is doing after surgery compared to before. I call this as a transition between states, e.g. severe pain to moderate pain, and in order to better illustrate these transitions I've created something that I call a transition plot. It's closely related to the plotMat for plotting networks but aimed at less complex relations with only a one-way relation between two groups of states. This project started by me posting a question on Stack Overflow, the answers were (as always) excellent, but didn't really satisfy my needs. What I wanted was a graphically appealing plot that I could control in extreme detail. Thanks to Paul Murrell's excellent grid package I was able to generate a truly customizeable transition plot. In this post I'll give a short introduction with examples to what you can do with the transitionPlot()-function. I'll try to walk you through simple transitions to more complex ones with group proportions and highlighted arrows. Simulate some data To illustrate a simple example we'll generate some data, imagine having a questionnaire for pre- and postoperative pain graded none, moderate, or major. We have the two variables in our data set, and to see the relation we just do a three-by-three table: library(Gmisc) library(Gmisc) \# Generate some fake data set.seed(9730) b4 Transitions None Moderate Major None 13 33 8 Moderate 50 107 30 Major 78 131 50 Simple example This is interpretable, but understanding the flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Visualizing it using the transition plot gives a quick and more intuitive understanding: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx) Here you can see the thick lines representing the transition from that particular group into the next. So far I've used the graph for the same measure on left and right side but I guess your imagination sets the limit. It can just as well be two or more treatment arms with some discrete outcomes. Simple with a twist In my previous post I documented how I created an arrow that allows perfect control over start, stop and width. Another annoying detail in the default bezier line, is that the arrows are perpendicular to each box, thus not following the line contour as expected. If we change the arrow type to my alternative arrow we get a nicer plot: \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "simple", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Note that I've also added a white background to each arrow in order to visually separate the arrows (the overlay order can be customized with the overlap\_order parameter). To further enhance the transition feeling I have added the option of a color gradient. To do this you need to specify arrow\_type = ``gradient'': \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) More complex coloring Additionally you can choose different colors for your boxes: library(RColorBrewer) transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, txt\_start\_clr = "black", txt\_end\_clr = "black", fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Pastel1"), fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Pastel1")[4:6], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Split boxes into proportions Sometimes you might want to split the color of each box into two colors, illustrating a proportion, for instance if we do wrist fracture surgery it might be interesting to explore if the left:right ratio differs. Note that the gradient color is a blend between the two proportions: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, box\_prop = cbind(c(0.3, 0.7, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.4)), txt\_start\_clr = c("black", "white"), txt\_end\_clr = c("black", "white"), fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Highlighting certain arrows Another interesting option may be to highlight a certain transition: arr\_clrs Summary Even though it may seem like a very simple plot, after some tweaking I believe the data-per-ink ratio turns out quite OK. I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. As always, don't hesitate to comment. The function transitionPlot is included in my Gmisc-package.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical techniques can provide visually compelling insights into complex data patterns. In this paper we present a type of lasagne plot showing changes in categorical variables for participants measured at regular intervals over time and propose statistical models to estimate distributions of marginal and transitional probabilities. Methods: The plot uses stacked bars to show the distribution of categorical variables at each time interval, with different colours to depict different categories and changes in colours showing trajectories of participants over time. The models are based on nominal logistic regression which is appropriate for both ordinal and nominal categorical variables. To illustrate the plots and models we analyse data on smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level from a longitudinal study on women's health. To estimate marginal distributions we fit survey wave as an explanatory variable whereas for transitional distributions we fit status of participants (e.g. smoking status) at previous surveys. Results: For the illustrative data the marginal models showed BMI increasing, physical activity decreasing and smoking decreasing linearly over time at the population level. The plots and transition models showed smoking status to be highly predictable for individuals whereas BMI was only moderately predictable and physical activity was virtually unpredictable. Most of the predictive power was obtained from participant status at the previous survey. Predicted probabilities from the models mostly agreed with observed probabilities indicating adequate goodness-of-fit. Conclusions: The proposed form of lasagne plot provides a simple visual aid to show transitions in categorical variables over time in longitudinal studies. The suggested models complement the plot and allow formal testing and estimation of marginal and transitional distributions. These simple tools can provide valuable insights into categorical data on individuals measured at regular intervals over time.},

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors among youth and youth adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The YRBSS includes a national, school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 24 state surveys, and nine local surveys conducted among high school students during February through May 1993. In the United States, 72\% of all deaths among school-age youth and young adults are from four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other intentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1993 YRBSS suggest many high school students practice behaviors that may increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 19.1\% rarely or never use a safety belt, 35.3\% had ridden during the 30 days preceding the survey with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 22.1\% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey, 80.9\% ever drank alcohol, 32.8\% ever used marijuana, and 8.6\% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among adolescents also result from unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study informed the definition of "excessive exercise" by examining relations between exercise behavior, eating-disordered behavior, and quality of life (QOL) in a community sample of women. METHOD: Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatory exercise and motivation for exercise, and of eating disorder psychopathology and QOL, were completed by 3,472 women aged 18-42 years who engaged in regular exercise. RESULTS: The extent to which exercise is intended to influence weight or shape and the degree to which guilt is experienced when exercise is postponed were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology and reduced QOL. Subgroups of participants who reported exercising solely for weight and shape reasons (n = 322 [9.3\%]), intense guilt after postponement of exercise (n = 136 [3.9\%]), or both (n = 116 [3.3\%]), had markedly elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology. There was no association between excessive exercise and reduced QOL after the effects of eating disorder psychopathology were statistically controlled. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that exercise is excessive when its postponement is accompanied by intense guilt or when it is undertaken solely to influence weight or shape. Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to these terms. The findings may also be of benefit in informing the content of prevention programs, which address dysfunctional exercise behavior. Excessive exercise is unlikely to be associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning in the absence of eating disorder psychopathology. It may, however, be a useful indicator of such psychopathology.},

  abstract = {Background Cross-sectional associations between anxiety disorders and eating disorders (EDs) have been well documented; however, limited research has examined whether symptoms of anxiety disorders are prospectively associated with EDs. Identifying these longitudinal associations can aid in discerning relationships among eating and anxiety disorders and point toward a mechanistic understanding of developmental psychopathology. This study investigated the prospective associations between parent-reported anxiety in mid-childhood (age 10) and child-reported ED behaviors and disorders in adolescence (at ages 14 and 16 years) in a population-based sample. Methods Participants were individuals enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective study of women and their children; 7,767 children whose parents provided data at age 10 were included in current analyses. An exploratory factor analysis identified latent anxiety factors at age 10, followed by a path analysis that evaluated associations between these factors and eating disorder symptoms and cognitions at age 14. Results Parent-reported anxiety symptoms at age 10 yielded 5 factors: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms related to symmetry and checking (Factor 1); OCD symptoms associated with aversion to dirt and germs (Factor 2); physical anxiety symptoms (Factor 3); worries (Factor 4); and social phobia symptoms (Factor 5). Factors 3 and 4 showed the most consistent, positive associations with a range of ED symptoms at age 14. Factor 3 predicted diagnosis of bulimia nervosa by age 16 (OR = 1.11, p = .007), whereas Factor 4 predicted diagnoses of anorexia nervosa (OR = 1.10, p = .01) and disordered eating by age 16 (OR = 1.08, p = .001). Conclusions Results indicate that symptoms of generalized anxiety in middle childhood may predict adolescent-onset ED symptoms and ED diagnoses.},

The current study examined whether social communication characteristics present in middle childhood (ages 8\textendash 14) were associated with eating disorder behaviors, cognitions, and diagnoses across adolescence (ages 14\textendash 18) in a large, population-based sample. Participants (N\,=\,4864) were children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective study of women and their children. Regression methods tested prospective associations between social functioning using a facial emotion recognition task and parentally reported social communication symptoms (or difficulties), measured by the Social Communication Disorder Checklist (SCDC), with eating disorder symptoms and diagnoses. Misattribution of faces as sad or angry at age 8.5 was associated with purging and anorexia nervosa diagnosis at age 14, respectively, among girls. Furthermore, autistic-like social communication difficulties during middle childhood were associated with bulimia nervosa symptoms during adolescence among both girls and boys. Results did not support global associations between measured social communication deficits and eating disorder risk in this sample, but specific difficulties with facial emotion recognition and social communication may enhance the risk for disordered eating behaviors.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Dysfunctional exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between experiences of exercise and ED behaviors and cognitions in an adolescent, population-based sample. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 4,054) self-reported whether they exercised to control shape and weight (exercise for weight loss [EWL]), and, if so, whether they exercised even when injured, and whether exercise interfered with life functioning (driven exercise) at age 14 years, allowing delineation of three exercise-based groups: no-EWL, EWL, and driven exercise. Participants also reported ED cognitions at age 14 years along with other ED behaviors (fasting, purging, binge eating) at ages 14 and 16 years. Sex-stratified regression approaches were employed to examine relationships between these exercise categories at age 14 and ED behaviors and cognitions at ages 14 and 16. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, those in the driven exercise group, compared to the no-EWL group, consistently reported higher levels of ED cognitions and behaviors, with those in the EWL group also reporting higher levels of some ED cognitions and behaviors relative to the no-EWL group. Those in the EWL and driven exercise groups at age 14 also demonstrated a higher prospective likelihood of fasting (boys and girls) and purging (girls only) at age 16, relative to those in the no-EWL group at age 14. DISCUSSION: Results inform our understanding of EWL and driven exercise and the developmental timing of ED behaviors in adolescence and point toward the potential utility of targeted prevention for young people who report EWL.},

Using data from 257 female undergraduates (aged 17-52 yrs), structural equation modeling revealed that the model accounted for 71\% of the variance in bulimic symptomatology. Results provide consistent support for the dual pathway model of bulimia nervosa. Body mass was positively related to perceived pressure for a thin body and BD. Perceived pressure was related to BD both directly and indirectly through IBI. Also, significant paths were found from BD to bulimic symptomatology through both dietary restraint and negative affect, and dietary restraint predicted negative affect. Prevention programs focusing on IBI, BD, restraint, and negative affect in middle schools could reduce the prevalence of bulimia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},
