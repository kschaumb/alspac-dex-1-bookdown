  abstract = {The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a transgenerational prospective observational study investigating influences on health and development across the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enroll pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrollment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.}

The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

  abstract = {Summary The Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children. All pregnant women resident in a defined area in the South West of England, with an expected date of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992, were eligible and 13\,761 women (contributing 13\,867 pregnancies) were recruited. These women have been followed over the last 19\textendash 22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17\textendash 18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {$>$}10\,000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available. Details of how to access these data are provided in this cohort profile.},

  abstract = {A transition between states - the above is a simulation of before and after surgery where I've highlighted the large proportion that doesn't improve in the moderate group. As an orthopaedic surgeon I'm often interested in how a patient is doing after surgery compared to before. I call this as a transition between states, e.g. severe pain to moderate pain, and in order to better illustrate these transitions I've created something that I call a transition plot. It's closely related to the plotMat for plotting networks but aimed at less complex relations with only a one-way relation between two groups of states. This project started by me posting a question on Stack Overflow, the answers were (as always) excellent, but didn't really satisfy my needs. What I wanted was a graphically appealing plot that I could control in extreme detail. Thanks to Paul Murrell's excellent grid package I was able to generate a truly customizeable transition plot. In this post I'll give a short introduction with examples to what you can do with the transitionPlot()-function. I'll try to walk you through simple transitions to more complex ones with group proportions and highlighted arrows. Simulate some data To illustrate a simple example we'll generate some data, imagine having a questionnaire for pre- and postoperative pain graded none, moderate, or major. We have the two variables in our data set, and to see the relation we just do a three-by-three table: library(Gmisc) library(Gmisc) \# Generate some fake data set.seed(9730) b4 Transitions None Moderate Major None 13 33 8 Moderate 50 107 30 Major 78 131 50 Simple example This is interpretable, but understanding the flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Visualizing it using the transition plot gives a quick and more intuitive understanding: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx) Here you can see the thick lines representing the transition from that particular group into the next. So far I've used the graph for the same measure on left and right side but I guess your imagination sets the limit. It can just as well be two or more treatment arms with some discrete outcomes. Simple with a twist In my previous post I documented how I created an arrow that allows perfect control over start, stop and width. Another annoying detail in the default bezier line, is that the arrows are perpendicular to each box, thus not following the line contour as expected. If we change the arrow type to my alternative arrow we get a nicer plot: \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "simple", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Note that I've also added a white background to each arrow in order to visually separate the arrows (the overlay order can be customized with the overlap\_order parameter). To further enhance the transition feeling I have added the option of a color gradient. To do this you need to specify arrow\_type = ``gradient'': \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) More complex coloring Additionally you can choose different colors for your boxes: library(RColorBrewer) transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, txt\_start\_clr = "black", txt\_end\_clr = "black", fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Pastel1"), fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Pastel1")[4:6], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Split boxes into proportions Sometimes you might want to split the color of each box into two colors, illustrating a proportion, for instance if we do wrist fracture surgery it might be interesting to explore if the left:right ratio differs. Note that the gradient color is a blend between the two proportions: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, box\_prop = cbind(c(0.3, 0.7, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.4)), txt\_start\_clr = c("black", "white"), txt\_end\_clr = c("black", "white"), fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Highlighting certain arrows Another interesting option may be to highlight a certain transition: arr\_clrs Summary Even though it may seem like a very simple plot, after some tweaking I believe the data-per-ink ratio turns out quite OK. I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. As always, don't hesitate to comment. The function transitionPlot is included in my Gmisc-package.},

The msm package for R allows a general multi-state model to be fitted to longitudinal data. Data often consist of observations of the process at arbitrary times, so that the exact times when the state changes are unobserved. For example, the progression of chronic diseases is often described by stages of severity, and the state of the patient may only be known at doctor or hospital visits. Features of msm include the ability to model transition rates and hidden Markov output models in terms of covariates, and the ability to model data with a variety of observation schemes, including censored states.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical techniques can provide visually compelling insights into complex data patterns. In this paper we present a type of lasagne plot showing changes in categorical variables for participants measured at regular intervals over time and propose statistical models to estimate distributions of marginal and transitional probabilities. Methods: The plot uses stacked bars to show the distribution of categorical variables at each time interval, with different colours to depict different categories and changes in colours showing trajectories of participants over time. The models are based on nominal logistic regression which is appropriate for both ordinal and nominal categorical variables. To illustrate the plots and models we analyse data on smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level from a longitudinal study on women's health. To estimate marginal distributions we fit survey wave as an explanatory variable whereas for transitional distributions we fit status of participants (e.g. smoking status) at previous surveys. Results: For the illustrative data the marginal models showed BMI increasing, physical activity decreasing and smoking decreasing linearly over time at the population level. The plots and transition models showed smoking status to be highly predictable for individuals whereas BMI was only moderately predictable and physical activity was virtually unpredictable. Most of the predictive power was obtained from participant status at the previous survey. Predicted probabilities from the models mostly agreed with observed probabilities indicating adequate goodness-of-fit. Conclusions: The proposed form of lasagne plot provides a simple visual aid to show transitions in categorical variables over time in longitudinal studies. The suggested models complement the plot and allow formal testing and estimation of marginal and transitional distributions. These simple tools can provide valuable insights into categorical data on individuals measured at regular intervals over time.},

  abstract = {Priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth and adults often are established during youth, extend into adulthood, and are interrelated. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors among youth and youth adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The YRBSS includes a national, school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 24 state surveys, and nine local surveys conducted among high school students during February through May 1993. In the United States, 72\% of all deaths among school-age youth and young adults are from four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other intentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1993 YRBSS suggest many high school students practice behaviors that may increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 19.1\% rarely or never use a safety belt, 35.3\% had ridden during the 30 days preceding the survey with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 22.1\% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey, 80.9\% ever drank alcohol, 32.8\% ever used marijuana, and 8.6\% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among adolescents also result from unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Dysfunctional exercise is a common, debilitating symptom across eating disorders (ED). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations  between experiences of exercise and ED behaviors and cognitions in an adolescent,  population-based sample. METHODS: Adolescents (n~= 4,054) self-reported whether they  exercised to control shape and weight (exercise for weight loss [EWL]), and, if so,  whether they exercised even when injured, and whether exercise interfered with life  functioning (driven exercise) at age 14~years, allowing delineation of three  exercise-based groups: no-EWL, EWL, and driven exercise. Participants also reported  ED cognitions at age 14~years along with other ED behaviors (fasting, purging, binge  eating) at ages 14 and 16~years. Sex-stratified regression approaches were employed  to examine relationships between these exercise categories at age 14 and ED  behaviors and cognitions at ages 14 and~16. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, those in the  driven exercise group, compared to the no-EWL group, consistently reported higher  levels of ED cognitions and behaviors, with those in the EWL group~also reporting  higher levels of some ED cognitions and behaviors relative to the no-EWL group.  Those in the EWL and driven exercise groups at age 14 also demonstrated a higher  prospective likelihood of fasting (boys and girls) and purging (girls only) at age  16, relative to those in the no-EWL group at age~14. DISCUSSION: Results inform our  understanding of EWL and driven exercise and the developmental timing of ED  behaviors in adolescence and point toward the potential utility of targeted  prevention for young people who report EWL.},
